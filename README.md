We introduce an indicator called 'Floor complexity', based on the floor plan images in Busan, Daegu, Daejeon, and Gwangju.

To drive the floor complexity index, we collect floor plan images, refine images, calculate Delentropy, and implement spatial interpolation.

This four-step process is necessary to effectively compute the green index, and sample data was stored in the 'DATA' folder to replicate this calculation.

Data in this repository consists of Excel and CSV files:
